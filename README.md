# Ordering System for cafe and bakery bar

  The ordering system developed for SMART Caf√© and Bakery Bar is a web application
 **optimized for tablets and computers**. This system was developed using a waterfall development model and took fifty-one days to complete.
The technologies used to develop this system include pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the front-end, with PHP programming language used for the back-end. Additionally, libraries such as jQuery, AJAX, DataTable.js, and Chart.js were employed to efficiently develop the system.
The ordering system has two sides: the admin side and the client side, with three user levels: operational staff, moderator staff, and admin. Operational staff primarily interact with the client side, while moderators and admins are associated with the admin side. The only difference between moderators and admins is that moderators cannot manage the staff, whereas admins can. The following are the user accounts that you can use to try out the system.
